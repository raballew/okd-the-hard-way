# Authentication

By default, only a kubeadmin user exists on your cluster. To specify an identity
provider, you must create a custom resource (CR) that describes that identity
provider and add it to the cluster. HTPasswd is an easy way to setup
authentication without relying external systems and is often used as a fallback
solution for `cluster-admin` users. To use the HTPasswd identity provider, a
secret that contains the HTPasswd user file must be defined. Additional
authentication providers such as LDAP should be configured afterwards.

```shell
[root@services ~]# htpasswd -c -B -b users.htpasswd root okd
[root@services ~]# oc create secret generic htpasswd-secret --from-file=htpasswd=/root/users.htpasswd -n openshift-config
[root@services ~]# oc apply -f okd-the-hard-way/src/okd/authentication/oauth-cluster.yaml
[root@services ~]# oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin root
```

Login as `root` user:

```shell
[root@services ~]# oc login -u root -p okd https://api.okd.example.com:6443
```

> If the authentication cluster operator is not available this command will fail
> with `error: couldn't get
> https://api.okd.example.com:6443/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server:
> unexpected response status 404`
